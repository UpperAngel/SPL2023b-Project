 * in the 'buffer' provided by the caller. The buffer should have enough space to hold at least 'max_len'
 * characters, including the null-terminator.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * - buffer: A pointer to a character array where the read characters will be stored.
 * - max_len: The maximum length of the line to read, including the null-terminator.
 * - source_file: A pointer to the FILE stream from which to read the line.
 *
 * Returns:
 * - On success: The function returns 'buffer', which contains the read line.
 * - On reaching the end-of-file before reading any characters: The function returns NULL.
 *
 * Description:
 * This custom implementation of 'fgets' reads characters from 'source_file' and stores them in 'buffer'
 * until one of the following conditions is met:
 *   - 'max_len-1' characters are read (to accommodate space for the null-terminator).
 *   - A newline character ('\n') is encountered, indicating the end of the line.
 *   - The end-of-file (EOF) is reached.
 * After reading the line, the function adds a null-terminator ('\0') at the end of 'buffer' to mark
 * the end of the string.
 *
 * If the line is longer than 'max_len-1' characters, the function will read the remaining characters
 * from the stream until a newline character or the end of the line is encountered. It discards the
 * exceeding characters to avoid buffer overflow.
 *
 * If the end-of-file is reached without reading any characters, and the 'buffer' is empty (char_count == 0),
 * the function returns NULL to indicate that there is no more data to read.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The 'buffer' should have enough space to hold at least 'max_len' characters (including the null-terminator)
 *   to avoid potential buffer overflows.
 * - The function may return a line shorter than 'max_len-1' characters if a newline character is encountered
 *   before reaching the limit.
 * - The caller should ensure that 'buffer' is a valid pointer and that 'max_len' is a positive integer.
 * - After using the returned line, the caller is responsible for managing the memory of the 'buffer'.
